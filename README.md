# Product Inventory Manager

## Description
This project enables users to track and manage a list of products easily. Users can add new items with detailed information, edit existing entries, delete products, and quickly search through the inventory. The UI updates dynamically, providing a smooth user experience, and all data changes persist via the mock API.

- **Add Product**: Use the form to create new products with name, description, price, and image URL.
-  **Edit Product**: Inline editing via the same form, with fields pre-populated for updates.
- **Delete Product**: Remove unwanted products with one click.
-  **Live Search**: Filter products by name in real time as you type.
-  **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop.
